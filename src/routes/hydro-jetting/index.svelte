<h3>Hydro-Jetting Sewer & Drain Lines</h3>
<p>Hydro-jetting uses specialized devices and highly pressurized water to break up and remove troublesome buildup in your pipes. Prior to starting the process, our licensed, insured technician will perform a detailed inspection of your system to check for damage. Once it is determined safe, a jetting hose will be inserted into the piping, and an appropriate amount of water pressure will be pumped into your pipe system.</p>
<p>This intense pressure will remove large amounts of buildup, increasing the overall health and efficiency of your plumbing system. With fewer blockages in the pipe, clogging becomes significantly less likely. This method works with pipes 1 Â½ inch to 24 inches in diameter.
	While this is not the answer for every problem, we can help you figure that out with a free estimate - based on over 3 decades of experience in sewer and drain cleaning.
	Businesses run an especially high risk of clogged drains/lines. Due to the increased volume, pipe issues can quickly get out of hand. Whether you need an estimate for your home, restaurant, hospital, or parking lot drains, call Wally Blanton Plumbing &amp; Sewer today at +1-847-345-8185 or +1-815-348-0336!
