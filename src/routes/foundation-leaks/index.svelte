<h2>Window Wells &amp; Foundation Leaks</h2>
<p>If a basement window well is not installed or sized properly, they may let in water. Cracks in your foundation can let in a significant amount of water as well. Without proper drainage, water can cause a large amount of damage to personal property as well as pose further risk to your health.</p>
<p>Water coming into the basement is not necessarily the issue, though. Lack of a proper avenue for that water to be disposed of? That’s when this becomes an issue. Without a sufficient drainage system, the small amount of water trickling in could turn into a very big problem.</p>
