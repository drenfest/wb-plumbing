<h2>Battery Backup Sump Pumps</h2>
<p>Power outages cause issues across a number of areas, both for businesses and homeowners. The first thing you may think of is damage to your electronic devices - but what about your basement? Wally Blanton Plumbing &amp; Sewer offers two different types of battery backup systems to better fit your needs and keep your basement dry.</p>
<p>One option is a battery powered system, giving power to your main sump pump. With a battery life of up to two operating weeks (depending on pump dimensions, elevation of release, etc).
	Option number two is a battery backup sump pump. This is a battery operated backup that will be set up next to the main pump.

<p>Basements flood regularly - donâ€™t find yourself caught with a wet basement. Backup your pump solutions today.</p>
