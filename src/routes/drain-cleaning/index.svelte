<h3>Drain Cleaning Services</h3>
<strong>Clogged pipes causing problems in your home or business? Frequent clogging? Your drains/pipes may need cleaning.</strong>
<p>You may be familiar with drain snaking - a somewhat stiff cable is pushed into a drain, following the curves and corners, until it punches a small hole through the blockage. The way we clean drains is similar, often referred to as power rodding. With a motorized cutting edge on the end of this cable, our technicians are able to rapidly cut through roots and debris, clearing a much larger hole in the blockage.</p>
<p>If you think you may need your drains unblocked, please call us at +1-847-345-8185-6719 or +1-815-348-0336 and ask about our $99.00 power-rodding special! Our technicians are professional, licensed, and capable.</p>
